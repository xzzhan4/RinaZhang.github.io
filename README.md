# A REDESIGNED USER INTERFACE FOR QBD 
#### QBD (https://www.qbd.com.au/) is an e-commercial website selling books. In this project, I 
- redesigned the UI for the website;
- made a protetype by Adobe XD; and
- develeped my web design using html5 + css3 + javascript.

#### The pages I made including:
- Homepage: https://xzzhan4.github.io/homepage.html
- Categories->Fiction: https://xzzhan4.github.io/categoryPage.html
- Milk and Honey: https://xzzhan4.github.io/productPage.html
- Pop up windows: click buy now; hover on checkout button;
- Shoppingcart: https://xzzhan4.github.io/shoppingcart.html
- Checkout: https://xzzhan4.github.io/payment.html

All of the pages can be explored with a start from homepage. The design is responsive and is accessible using both laptop and mobile phone.
